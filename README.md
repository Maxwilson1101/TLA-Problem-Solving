# TLA+ Problem Solving

A collection of formal specifications for classic algorithms and puzzles.

- **Breadth-First Search**: Modeling graph traversal and state discovery.
- **8-Puzzle Game**: Exploring state-space search and reachability in sliding puzzles.

TODO:
- [ ] **BFS Invariants**: Formally specify and verify queue properties (e.g., monotonicity of distances in the queue).
- [ ] **8-Puzzle Solvability**: Define theorems to identify solvable vs. unsolvable configurations (e.g., using parity arguments/inversions).
